# Zeldar: Categorical Fortune-Telling System

## Overview

Zeldar represents a categorical formalization of fortune-telling systems as implemented through CatColab diagrams. This project bridges historical fortune-teller robots with modern categorical orchestration theory, creating a mathematically rigorous framework for divination systems.

## Categorical Structure

### Base Category: FortuneC
- **Objects**: States of knowledge (Past, Present, Future, Unknown)
- **Morphisms**: Temporal transitions and information revelation patterns
- **Functors**: Mapping between different divination modalities

### Diagram Types
1. **Temporal Flows**: Past → Present → Future transitions
2. **Information Revelation**: Unknown → Known transformations  
3. **Behavioral Domains**: User interaction patterns
4. **Orchestration Patterns**: Multi-modal fortune synthesis

## CatColab Integration

This system uses CatColab's categorical modeling capabilities to:
- Model fortune-telling as functorial mappings
- Represent temporal logic through categorical diagrams
- Orchestrate multiple divination methods categorically
- Maintain coherence across different fortune modalities

## Usage

Each diagram represents a specific aspect of the fortune-telling process, formalized as categorical constructions that can be composed and orchestrated through CatColab's framework.
