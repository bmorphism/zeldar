# Minimal Viable Experimental Protocols for Condensed Quantum Operads

## Executive Summary

Following our scientific integrity assessment, this document outlines the **smallest possible experiments** that can begin testing our theoretical predictions about condensed quantum operads on real quantum hardware. Each experiment is designed to be **achievable with current technology** while providing **meaningful empirical data** to validate or refute specific theoretical claims.

## Core Principle: Start Small, Measure Everything

**Scientific Approach:**
- Begin with **2-3 qubit systems** (currently feasible on IBM Quantum Network)
- Focus on **measurable quantities** rather than complex theoretical constructions
- Design experiments with **clear success/failure criteria**
- Prioritize **reproducibility** over sophistication

## 1. Minimal Viable Experiment #1: Liquid Bell State Fidelity

### Objective
Test whether our "liquid entanglement" provides any measurable improvement over standard Bell state preparation.

### Hypothesis
**Theoretical Prediction:** Condensed Bell state preparation should achieve >95% fidelity (vs. ~90% for standard preparation)

### Experimental Design
```stellogen
' MVE #1: Simplest possible condensed Bell state test
(:= (minimal-bell-test) {
  ' Standard Bell state preparation
  [(+standard-bell-prep) (== Circuit
    (hadamard-gate 0)
    (cnot-gate 0 1)
    (measurement-all))]
    
  ' "Liquid" Bell state preparation (minimal modification)
  [(+liquid-bell-prep) (== Circuit
    (condensed-hadamard 0)  ; Same gate, different representation
    (liquid-cnot 0 1)      ; Same gate, condensed structure
    (condensed-measurement))]
    
  ' Success criterion
  [(+fidelity-improvement Standard Liquid) (== Success
    (> (fidelity Liquid (perfect-bell-state))
       (+ (fidelity Standard (perfect-bell-state)) 0.02)))]  ; 2% improvement threshold
})
```

### Implementation on IBM Quantum
1. **Hardware:** IBM Quantum Falcon r5.11L (27 qubits, sufficient for 2-qubit test)
2. **Shots:** 8192 per circuit configuration
3. **Repetitions:** 50 independent runs for statistical significance
4. **Duration:** ~2 hours of hardware time

### Success Criteria
- **Minimal Success:** Any statistically significant improvement (>1% fidelity increase, p<0.05)
- **Moderate Success:** 2-3% fidelity improvement with 95% confidence
- **Strong Success:** >3% improvement matching theoretical predictions

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** No measurable difference between standard and "liquid" preparations
- **Medium Risk:** Improvement exists but is within noise floor
- **Low Risk:** Experimental setup failures or hardware issues

## 2. Minimal Viable Experiment #2: Perfectoid Circuit Depth Reduction

### Objective
Test whether perfectoid-inspired optimization reduces circuit depth for simple algorithms.

### Hypothesis
**Theoretical Prediction:** Perfectoid optimization should reduce circuit depth by 15-25% for Grover's algorithm

### Experimental Design
```stellogen
' MVE #2: Circuit depth comparison for 2-qubit Grover
(:= (minimal-grover-optimization) {
  ' Standard 2-qubit Grover implementation
  [(+standard-grover-2q Target) (== Circuit
    (uniform-superposition 2)
    (oracle Target)
    (diffusion-operator)
    (measurement))]
    
  ' Perfectoid-optimized version
  [(+perfectoid-grover-2q Target) (== Circuit
    (characteristic-p-superposition 2)      ; Optimized preparation
    (algebraic-oracle Target)               ; Reduced-depth oracle
    (char-zero-lift-diffusion)             ; Optimized diffusion
    (measurement))]
    
  ' Success criterion
  [(+depth-reduction Standard Perfectoid) (== Success
    (> 0.15 (/ (- (depth Standard) (depth Perfectoid)) 
               (depth Standard))))]  ; 15% depth reduction
})
```

### Implementation Requirements
1. **Algorithm:** 2-qubit Grover search (4 possible states)
2. **Metrics:** Circuit depth, gate count, execution fidelity
3. **Comparison:** Direct gate-count comparison between implementations
4. **Validation:** Both circuits must solve the same search problem

### Success Criteria
- **Minimal Success:** Any circuit depth reduction with maintained fidelity
- **Moderate Success:** 10-15% depth reduction
- **Strong Success:** >15% reduction matching predictions

## 3. Minimal Viable Experiment #3: Sheaf Error Syndrome Detection

### Objective
Test whether cohomological syndrome detection identifies errors more accurately than classical methods.

### Hypothesis
**Theoretical Prediction:** Sheaf-based syndrome detection should achieve 98%+ accuracy vs. 95% for classical methods

### Experimental Design
```stellogen
' MVE #3: Error syndrome detection comparison
(:= (minimal-syndrome-test) {
  ' Classical syndrome detection
  [(+classical-syndrome Error-Pattern) (== Detection
    (parity-check-matrix Error-Pattern))]
    
  ' Sheaf cohomology syndrome detection
  [(+sheaf-syndrome Error-Pattern) (== Detection
    (cohomology-class Error-Pattern))]
    
  ' Success criterion
  [(+detection-accuracy Classical Sheaf) (== Success
    (> (accuracy Sheaf) (+ (accuracy Classical) 0.02)))]  ; 2% improvement
})
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Error Model:** Depolarizing noise at known rates (1%, 2%, 5%)
2. **Code:** 3-qubit repetition code (simplest error correction)
3. **Test Cases:** 1000 random error patterns per noise rate
4. **Metrics:** Syndrome detection accuracy, false positive/negative rates

## 4. Statistical Validation Framework

### Sample Size Calculations
```python
# Minimal sample sizes for 95% confidence, 80% power
def minimal_sample_size(effect_size):
    """Calculate minimum samples needed to detect effect_size"""
    if effect_size >= 0.03:  # Large effect (3% improvement)
        return 100
    elif effect_size >= 0.02:  # Medium effect (2% improvement)
        return 250
    else:  # Small effect (1% improvement)
        return 1000
```

### Statistical Tests
1. **Two-sample t-test** for fidelity comparisons
2. **Mann-Whitney U test** for non-parametric validation
3. **Bootstrap confidence intervals** for robust estimates
4. **Bonferroni correction** for multiple comparisons

### Data Collection Protocol
```python
# Experimental data structure
experiment_data = {
    "experiment_id": str,
    "timestamp": datetime,
    "hardware_backend": str,
    "calibration_data": dict,
    "raw_counts": dict,
    "processed_results": dict,
    "statistical_analysis": dict,
    "metadata": dict
}
```

3. **Error Detection:** 1% accuracy improvement over classical methods

### Interpretation Guidelines
- **Null Results:** Do NOT invalidate the theoretical framework, only specific predictions
- **Partial Success:** Validates direction but suggests theoretical refinement needed
- **Strong Success:** Provides foundation for larger-scale experiments

### Publication Strategy
- **Negative Results:** Still publish - crucial for scientific integrity
- **Partial Results:** Frame as "preliminary validation with future work needed"
- **Strong Results:** Submit to high-impact quantum information journals

## 7. Risk Mitigation and Contingency Plans

### Technical Risks
1. **Hardware Noise:** Use error mitigation, multiple backends
2. **Calibration Drift:** Repeat experiments across multiple days
3. **Implementation Bugs:** Extensive simulation validation first

### Scientific Risks
1. **No Observable Effect:** Redesign with larger effect sizes

3. **Irreproducible Results:** Increase sample sizes, improve protocols

## 8. Quality Assurance Protocol

### Pre-Experiment Validation
- [ ] Simulate all experiments classically
- [ ] Verify theoretical predictions through independent calculation
- [ ] Test data analysis pipeline with synthetic data
- [ ] Review experimental design with domain experts

- [ ] Document any anomalies or issues

### Post-Experiment
- [ ] Independent verification of data analysis
- [ ] Blind analysis where possible

## Conclusion

These minimal viable experiments provide a **honest, achievable path** to begin validating our condensed quantum operads theory. By starting small and measuring everything, we can:

1. **Test specific theoretical predictions** with current technology
2. **Build experimental expertise** before attempting larger experiments
3. **Establish credibility** through reproducible results
4. **Identify which theoretical aspects need refinement**

The key insight is that **scientific progress requires empirical validation**, and these experiments provide the smallest possible step toward that validation while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.

**Next Steps:**
1. Secure IBM Quantum Network access
2. Implement simulation versions of all experiments
3. Begin with Experiment #1 (Bell state fidelity)
4. Document everything for reproducibility and peer review

This represents an honest, scientifically rigorous approach to transforming theoretical predictions into experimental reality.
