## The Three Great Eras

### [🔧 Mechanical Era (1867-1900)](/history/early-period)
**The Dawn of Automated Prophecy**
- **1867**: J. Parkes patents first fortune machine in England
- **1891**: Roover Brothers' Donkey Wonder & Elephant Wonder
- **1896**: Madame Zita automaton - first costumed fortune-teller

*Key Innovation*: **Coin-activated disk selection** and **spring-driven clockwork**

---

### [⚡ Electromechanical Era (1900-1950)](/history/electromechanical) 
**The Age of Electrical Enchantment**
- **1906**: Mills Novelty Company Gypsy Fortune Teller
- **1920s**: Mutoscope's sophisticated "Grandmother's Predictions"
- **1925**: Exhibit Supply's Oracle Fortune Teller series

*Key Innovation*: **Solenoid animation** and **relay-controlled sequencing**

---

### [🤖 Animatronic Era (1950s+)](/history/animatronics)
**The Pinnacle of Mechanical Artistry**
- **1957**: Genco Gypsy Grandma - most sophisticated ever built
- **1961**: Admiral Vending's modular puppet systems
- **Modern Era**: Digital revival and preservation efforts

*Key Innovation*: **Multi-axis movement**, **breathing simulation**, and **precision card manipulation**

## Technical Foundations

The evolution of fortune-telling machines showcased remarkable engineering innovations:

- **Cam Shaft Systems**: Precisely programmed movement sequences
- **Pneumatic Breathing**: Lifelike chest movement simulation  
- **Mechanical Card Gripping**: Individual finger articulation
- **Timer Circuits**: Sophisticated timing mechanisms by Seeburg
- **12-Point Stabilization**: Smooth, floating movement systems

*Each era built upon the mechanical wisdom of its predecessors, creating increasingly lifelike oracles that blurred the line between automation and animation.*
